# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using a graphical user interface (GUI). Players take turns as 'X' and 'O', clicking buttons to mark their moves. The program checks for win conditions after each turn and announces the winner. The interface uses Swing for design and updates dynamically.
